                <h2>Project Idea - Fully integrated AI cybersecurity software</h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p class="text-break">This project will propose the use of AI models and machine learning to boost cybersecurity defence for an organisation.
                    By using all endpoints (individual computers / devices for each employee), server usage data and running alongside applications, the AI model
                    will have far more data to work with compared to current antivirus or business security solutions. Thus, will help circumvent with attacks that
                    rely on compromised accounts or zero-day attacks in addition to the usual malware attacks. The necessary hardware is already available, currently
                    ‘only’ an AI model and time is needed. There is also a demand for using AI to enhance cybersecurity, thus making this product profitable once all
                    technical details are worked out and a fully developed product is ready to hit the market.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p class="text-break">According to a study by Stanford University, “88% data breach incidents are caused by employees’ mistakes” (CISOMAG, 2020). As human
                    error is the primary cause of cybersecurity incidents, there is a market for more advanced cybersecurity software beyond the usual email, links and virus
                    scans most existing solutions offer. Another aspect is improving Protection against 0-day attacks. As documented in Google’s report
                    (Maddie Stone and Clement Lecigne, 2021), there has been a consistent uptick in 0-Day vulnerabilities detected following 2018. Furthermore
                    “Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US $1billion in 2016 to a US $34.8 billion net worth by 2025”
                    (Taddeo, McCutcheon and Floridi, 2019), thus making this a financially viable investment. </p>
